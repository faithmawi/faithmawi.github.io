title: Linking services to NHS login
---


 NHS login provides capability for users to change their NHS login settings online, helping to reduce calls into your support desks. 
 
 To help users do this, NHS login needs you to create a link from your service to the NHS login settings page. 
 
 Users will need to be logged into your service to use this link.
 Use the [NHS login Link to Settings Page presentation](https://github.com/nhsconnect/nhslogin/raw/master/NHSlogin%20Link%20to%20Settings%20Page%20v1.0.pptx) for guidance on this.

 ## NHS login currently allows users to:

- change their email address
- change their password
- change their mobile phone number
- delete their NHS login
