title: How can I test NHS login in my service?
---

 We have a stub and a sandpit that development teams can use to familiarise themselves with NHS login.

 ## NHS login stub
 We have developed a lightweight stub that is a representation of our OIDC endpoints. You can find out more about the stub and access it here: https://stub.signin.nhs.uk/client. The stub is entirely self-service and requires no registration.

 ## Sandpit
 Our sandpit is a deployment of much of the production code, with some elements of the registration process removed e.g. matching to NHS number and checking ID documents.
