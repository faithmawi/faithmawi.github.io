 ## Using NHS login to create or retrieve GP credentials

 
 If you are an IM1 supplier, learn how to use NHS login to create or retrieve GP credentials. 
 
 These include an Account ID, ODS Code and Linkage Key. This means users do not have to go their GP practice to register for your service.
 
 Use the [NHS login GPIC presentation](https://github.com/nhsconnect/nhslogin/raw/master/NHSlogin%20GPIC%20v1.0.pptx) for guidance on this.
