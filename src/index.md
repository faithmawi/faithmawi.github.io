title: What is NHS login?
---
NHS login is a new way for people to prove who they are online, so they can access health and care websites or apps safely and securely.

By integrating NHS login to your website or app you can offer users self-service access. You can also choose the level and combination of verification and authentication required for user access.

NHS login is based on OpenID Connect (OIDC), which is an open standard. You can find out more about our use of OIDC by reading the external interface specification (EIS).
